# fix-it
FixIt is an app that has the sole purpose of connecting firms that offer practical services (such as plumbing, carpentry etc.) with potential clients, in a user-friendly way. 

Steps for setting up the backend:
`npm install`
`npm run start` (and, if you want to get a temporary public IP for the mobile app, you can use `ngrok http 3000` **after** you've set up the backend)
