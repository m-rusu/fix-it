# fix-it
FixIt is an app that has the sole purpose of connecting firms that offer practical services (such as plumbing, carpentry etc.) with potential clients, in a user-friendly way. 

Steps for setting up the backend:
`npm install`
`npm run start` (or, if you want to get a temporary public IP to use with the mobile app, `ngrok http 3000`)
